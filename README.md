This page was made for a college project; It's **not** mobile-friendly (yet), sorry ðŸ˜….

Made by [caiodomingues](https://github.com/caiodomingues) and [thobiasvicente](https://github.com/thobiasvicente)

## Instructions

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/caiodomingues/MaskClub.git
$ cd MaskClub

$ cd frontend
$ yarn
$ yarn start

$ cd backend
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
```

**Note:** For the correct usage of the project, it's necessary to copy the `.env_example` file, with the name `.env` and configure the connection string of a MongoDB database.

## Docs

There's a basic code documentation made with JSDocs/TSDocs.

You can check the page design (please note that doesn't reflect the final result) on [this folder](https://github.com/caiodomingues/MaskClub/blob/master/docs/design/)

### API

You can find the Insomnia documentation file [here](https://github.com/caiodomingues/MaskClub/blob/master/docs/routes_api.json).

For a better understanding, the API documentation is structured like:

#### Auth

The project needs to implement a basic JWT Auth, you can use the following routes:

- [x] 1. Create: User creation: insomnia - Create - POST
- [x] 2. Login: User authentication: insomnia - Login - POST

#### Events

The core of the project is creating a simple application that handles an Event creation (doesn't handle edition), you can get a single or all events information, save and destroy an event, and there's a route for implementing a Like/Dislike feature as well.

- [x] 3. Index: User list: insomnia - Index - GET
- [x] 4. Show: Event view: insomnia - Show - GET
- [x] 5. Store: Event creation: insomnia - Create - POST
- [x] 6. Destroy: Event deletion: insomnia - Delete - DELETE
- [x] 7. Like/Dislike: Event Like / dislike: insomnia - Like/Dislike - POST*

<sup>* This route is could be done using Socket.io to make information broadcast, but we've decided to not take this project so deep</sup>
